****Tomato Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks****

**Introduction**
This project focuses on developing a robust Tomato Disease Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model aims to accurately classify tomato images into various disease categories, assisting in early detection and prevention measures for agricultural purposes.

**Required Libraries**
•pandas
•tensorflow
•matplotlib

**Code Overview**
The provided code demonstrates the evaluation and visualization of a trained CNN model for tomato disease classification. It includes the following components:

•**Evaluation**: Evaluation of the trained model using the **evaluate()** function to compute loss and accuracy scores.
•**Training History:** Accessing the training history to extract metrics such as accuracy and loss over epochs.
•**Visualization:** Plotting training and validation accuracy curves using Matplotlib to visualize model performance.

**How to Use**
**1.Dependencies:** Ensure required libraries (pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib) are installed.
**2.Data Preparation:** Organize tomato images dataset into appropriate directories.
**3.Model Training:** Train the CNN model using the provided dataset partitions.
**4.Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model using the test dataset to assess its performance.
**5.Visualization:** Visualize training and validation accuracy curves to analyze model performance.
